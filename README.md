# Hatchat

If you ever had the experience that you would enjoy talking to someone in your contacts but it would be awkward to start a conversation with them, Hatchat will be able to send a random message or call someone that you choose.

It uses Parse as a form of analytics (to track what the users do... only works if they have access to internet).

Functionality:

-can sms and call

-can select groups of people who you would want to message or call

-has 2 widgets to open random sending or calling quicker 

-all functionality works offline
