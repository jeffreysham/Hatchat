# Hatchat

If you ever had the experience that you would enjoy talking to someone in your contacts but it would be awkward to start a conversation with them, do not worry! Hatchat removes the awkwardness by sending a random message or by calling someone that you chose. So, the person that receives the message will know that they were chosen by random and will be more open to conversating with you.

It uses Parse as a form of analytics (to track what the users do... only works if they have access to internet).

Functionality:

-can sms and call (uses phone's built in sms and calling, so it might cost you money)

-can select groups of people who you would want to message or call

-has 2 widgets to open random sending or calling quicker 

-all functionality works offline
