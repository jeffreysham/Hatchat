This is a messaging application that the user writes a message and sends it to a random user.

It uses Parse as a form of analytics (to track what the users do... only works if they have access to internet). 

The username is theflutterapp. The password is flutterapp.

Idea for free and paid version:
Free - can sms, has to maintain 15+ friends on contact list in order to send sms, has widget, ads, removes messaged contact
Paid ($.99) - can sms + call, has to maintain 3+ or 5+ friends on contact list, has better widget, remove ads, does not remove messaged contact
Freemium - same as free, pay some money to unlock paid version features

Ideas for future:
- Integrate other messaging systems and contacts (Facebook messaging, WeChat, Whatsapp, Groupme, Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.)
- Add video chat
- Multimedia messaging
